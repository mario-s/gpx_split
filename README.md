# Gpx Splitter

This app was created out of the need to split large GPX files into smaller chunks for GPS devices which can handle only a limmiten number of track points. Another possible use case is, to split a large track into smaller pieces for daily stages.

## Install Requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running
`python . <GPX_FILE> [-o <OUTPUT_DIR>] [-l True]`
